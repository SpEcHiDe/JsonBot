## JsonBot

- a simple telegram bot that returns the `telegram-bot-api` json of all the sent messages

Can be found on **Telegram Production Server** as
ðŸ‘‰ [@useTGxBot](https://useTGxBot.t.me)

### OR

Can be found on **Telegram Test Server** as
ðŸ‘‰ [@ShowJsonBot](https://t.me/ShowJsonBot)

### ðŸ¤” why ~~yet another~~ Telegram Bot ?

did not find a telegram bot, which could return with all the latest [telegram features](https://t.me/BotNews/64).

### Why grammY ?

This project started by using plain
[node-fetch](https://github.com/SpEcHiDe/JsonBot/blob/71dd2de533ae2a3cee777e75006b5f54b0fe274d/src/index.ts)
and all was in a single file. Since, this is a small telegram bot project it was
fine to have it in a single file. Adding **grammY** was an attempt to check if
re-using the existing libraries could reduce the effort in creating this simple
bot.
